Here’s how to deploy a React app to popular platforms:

1. Vercel
How:
    Go to vercel.com, sign in with GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.
    Click "New Project" and import your repo.
    Vercel auto-detects React and deploys it.
Push to main branch to redeploy.

2. Netlify
How:
    Go to netlify.com, sign in with GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.
    Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project".
    Select your repo, set build command (npm run build) and publish directory (build).
    Netlify auto-deploys on push.

3. AWS (S3 + CloudFront or Amplify)
S3 + CloudFront:
    Build your app: npm run build
    Upload the build/ folder to an S3 bucket (set as static website).
    (Optional) Use CloudFront for CDN and HTTPS.
AWS Amplify:
    Go to AWS Amplify.
    Connect your repo and follow the setup wizard.

- Vercel and Netlify are easiest for most React apps (free tier, auto CI/CD).
- AWS is more customizable for enterprise or advanced needs.
- Always build your app (npm run build) before deploying.
