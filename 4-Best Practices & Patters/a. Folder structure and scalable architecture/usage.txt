Here are some best practices for folder structure and scalable architecture in React projects:
1. Common Folder Structure

my-app/
│
├── public/
│
├── src/
│   ├── assets/           # Images, fonts, etc.
│   ├── components/       # Reusable UI components
│   ├── features/         # Feature-based folders (recommended for scaling)
│   │   ├── auth/
│   │   │   ├── AuthPage.jsx
│   │   │   ├── authSlice.js
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   └── dashboard/
│   │       ├── DashboardPage.jsx
│   │       └── ...
│   ├── hooks/            # Custom hooks
│   ├── contexts/         # React context providers
│   ├── utils/            # Utility functions
│   ├── services/         # API calls, data fetching
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── index.js
│   └── ...
│
├── package.json
└── README.md

2. Scalable Architecture Tips

 - Feature-based structure: Group files by feature, not by type. This keeps related logic together and scales better for large apps.
 - Keep components small and focused: Each component should do one thing well.
 - Use index.js for re-exports: Simplifies imports from folders.
 - Separate business logic from UI: Use hooks, services, or state management for logic, and keep components focused on rendering.
 - Use absolute imports: Configure your project to use absolute paths for easier importing.

3. Example Feature Folder

src/features/todos/
├── TodoList.jsx
├── TodoItem.jsx
├── todosSlice.js      # Redux slice or state logic
├── todosAPI.js        # API calls
└── index.js           # Re-export for easy import


> Organize by feature for scalability.
> Separate concerns (UI, logic, data).
> Use folders for hooks, contexts, and utilities.
> Keep your codebase clean and maintainable as it grows.
