Here’s how to do code splitting and lazy loading in React:

1. React.lazy & Suspense
Dynamically load components only when needed, reducing initial bundle size.

import React, { Suspense } from 'react';

// Lazy load the component
const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Main App</h2>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <LazyComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

 - React.lazy() lets you import a component only when it’s rendered.
 - Suspense shows a fallback (like a loading spinner) while the component loads.
 - Use React.lazy and Suspense for code splitting and lazy loading.
 - This improves performance by loading code only when needed.
