Here’s a project idea for practice:

Blog with Markdown Support

Features to Implement:
    Blog post list page
    Single post page (render markdown as HTML)
    Create/edit post page (markdown editor)
    Delete post functionality
    (Optional): User authentication for creating/editing/deleting
    Responsive design

Tech Stack Suggestions:
    React Router for navigation
    Context API or Redux for post/user state (optional)
    Markdown parser: marked, remark, or react-markdown
    UI library (Material UI, Chakra UI, Tailwind CSS, or your own styles)

Basic Folder Structure:

src/
  components/
    PostList.jsx
    PostItem.jsx
    PostEditor.jsx
    PostView.jsx
    Navbar.jsx
    ProtectedRoute.jsx
  context/
    AuthContext.jsx
    PostContext.jsx
  App.jsx
  index.js



Key Implementation Steps:
    Set up routing for list, view, and edit pages.
    Create PostContext (or Redux slice) to manage posts.
    Use a markdown parser to render markdown as HTML.
    Build post list and single post view.
    Build post editor with a textarea for markdown input.
    Add create, edit, and delete functionality.
    (Optional): Add authentication for protected actions.


Example: Rendering Markdown with react-markdown

import React from 'react';
import ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown';

function PostView({ content }) {
  return <ReactMarkdown>{content}</ReactMarkdown>;
}
