Here’s a project idea for practice:

E-commerce Frontend

Features to Implement:
    Product listing page (grid or list view)
    Product detail page
    Shopping cart (add, remove, update quantity)
    Checkout page (form validation)
    Order confirmation page
    User authentication (login/signup, optional)
    Responsive design
    (Optional): Product search, filter, and sort

Tech Stack Suggestions:
    React Router for navigation
    Context API or Redux for cart and user state
    Formik or React Hook Form for checkout forms
    Mock API (e.g., fakestoreapi.com or your own mock)
    UI library (Material UI, Chakra UI, Tailwind CSS, or your own styles)

Basic Folder Structure:

src/
  components/
    ProductList.jsx
    ProductCard.jsx
    ProductDetail.jsx
    Cart.jsx
    CheckoutForm.jsx
    Navbar.jsx
    ProtectedRoute.jsx
  context/
    CartContext.jsx
    AuthContext.jsx
  App.jsx
  index.js

Key Implementation Steps:
    Set up routing for product list, detail, cart, and checkout.
    Create CartContext (or Redux slice) to manage cart state.
    Fetch product data from a mock API.
    Build product list and detail pages.
    Implement cart functionality (add, remove, update).
    Build checkout form with validation.
    Add order confirmation page.
    (Optional): Add authentication and protected routes.
