Here’s a project idea for practice:

Dashboard with Authentication

Features to Implement:
    Login/Signup page (with form validation)
    Protected dashboard route (only accessible after login)
    Sidebar navigation (e.g., Home, Profile, Settings)
    Display user info (fetched from API or mock data)
    Logout functionality
    Responsive design

Tech Stack Suggestions:
    React Router for routing and protected routes
    Context API or Redux for auth state
    Formik or React Hook Form for forms
    Mock API (e.g., jsonplaceholder or your own mock)
    Optional: Use Material UI, Chakra UI, or Tailwind CSS for UI

Basic Folder Structure:

src/
  components/
    AuthForm.jsx
    Sidebar.jsx
    Dashboard.jsx
    ProtectedRoute.jsx
  context/
    AuthContext.jsx
  App.jsx
  index.js


Key Implementation Steps:
    Set up routing with React Router.
    Create AuthContext to manage login state.
    Build AuthForm for login/signup.
    Create ProtectedRoute component to guard dashboard routes.
    Build Dashboard with sidebar and user info.
    Add logout and redirect logic.
