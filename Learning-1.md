1. React Core Concepts (Quick Review)
JSX: Syntax extension for JavaScript.
Components: Functional and class components.
Props & State: Passing data and managing local state.
Event Handling: Handling user events.

2. Intermediate React
Hooks:
useState, useEffect, useContext
Custom hooks
Component Composition:
Children, render props, higher-order components (HOC)
Context API:
Global state management without Redux
Forms:
Controlled vs uncontrolled components
Form libraries (Formik, React Hook Form)
Routing:
React Router (v6+)
Fetching Data:
Fetch API, Axios, SWR, React Query

3. Advanced React
Performance Optimization:
Memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
Code splitting, lazy loading (React.lazy, Suspense)
Error Boundaries
Testing:
Unit testing with Jest, React Testing Library
TypeScript with React (optional but recommended)
State Management:
Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Recoil, Jotai, or MobX
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Static Site Generation (SSG):
Next.js framework
Custom Hooks & Reusable Components
Accessibility (a11y)
Animations:
Framer Motion, React Spring

4. Best Practices & Patterns
Folder structure and scalable architecture
Prop drilling vs context vs state management
Code splitting and lazy loading
Environment variables and configuration

5. Ecosystem & Tooling
Linting (ESLint), formatting (Prettier)
DevTools (React DevTools, Redux DevTools)
Deployment (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, etc.)

6. Project Ideas for Practice
Dashboard with authentication
E-commerce frontend
Blog with markdown support
Real-time chat app (with sockets)
Integrate with REST APIs or GraphQL
